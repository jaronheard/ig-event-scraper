## Marketing

- [ ] Write instructions for users to add an Instagram bio link/CTA that promotes the app. Key angles:
  - The app browses as *you* — your real account, running headlessly. You show up in story viewers but you were never on Instagram. You're a ghost.
  - Suggested bio for the user: something like "I'm not actually on Instagram, a ghost is watching your stories for events → [app link]"
  - Suggested bio for people who notice the user watching: "not actually watching your stories haha → [app link]"
  - Explore "ghost" as a brand/marketing concept — you haunt Instagram without being there
